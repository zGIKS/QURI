# Image Upload Feature - Design Lab

## Overview

This feature allows users to upload images to their Design Lab projects using Cloudinary as the cloud storage provider. The uploaded images are automatically converted to image layers that can be positioned and styled within the project.

**Purpose**: Handles image uploads to Cloudinary
- Uploads images to Cloudinary with proper validation
- Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP formats
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Automatically organizes images in a "design-lab" folder

**Key Methods**:
- `uploadImage(file: File)` - Uploads image to Cloudinary
- `isValidImageFile(file: File)` - Validates file type and size
- `getSupportedFormats()` - Returns supported image formats
- `getMaxFileSize()` - Returns maximum allowed file size

### 2. ImageUploadComponent (`/src/app/design-lab/components/image-upload/image-upload.component.ts`)

**Purpose**: Provides UI for image upload
- Material Design file upload button
- Progress indicator during upload
- Success/error feedback with snackbar notifications
- File validation with user-friendly error messages

**Events**:

  }
  ```
